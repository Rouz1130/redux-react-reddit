npm install redux, react-redux and redux-thunk
Initialize the Redux store and hook up thunk middleware in index.js
Redux is an implementation of the flux architecture( a pattern for passing data around in a React App)
*Classic Flux: app state is held within stores. Dispatched actions cause this state to change, after which the views listen to these state changes will re-render themselves accordingly.
Store: Holds the global app state.
React Views: Connected React components listen on parts of the store.
Action Handlers: Most business logic and side effects are implemented here.
(store pass 'Props' to the 'View' the view dispatch the 'action' to Action-Handlers then the A-H updates 'State' to store. )
Flux simplifies data flow in a single direction.
Flux key terms: 'Reducers', 'Selectors', 'thunks'.Various names of Redux constructs that implement the different parts of the cycle.
Explanation of these terms and there contribution to the different parts of the cycle.
'Selectors': digest parts of the state to make easier props for the views.
'map state to props': connected components specify what state they want as props.
'thunks': async, dispatch other action sand do side-effects.
'reducers': update state, taking state + action and return new state.

PROJECT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
/src/components: 'dumb' React components that have no knowledge of redux
/src/containers: 'smart' React components that are connected to our redux store.
/src/services: Abstraction facades for external API(like backend servers).
/src/store: All Redux-specific code goes here, including all business-logic of our app.

'store' directory is organized by domain , each containing:
/src/store/{domain}/reducers.js: Reducer as a default export with all selectors names as exports.
/src/store/{domain}/action.js: All the domain action handlers (thunks and plain object creators)

A STATE-FRIST APPROACH:
Easiest way to approach this architecture is start with 'state'.
For this example our app 'state'. for this tutorial we have two pages. We will start with the first page.
-First page will have a 'List'(topics) retrieved from the server.
-Also we will need to hold 'ID's' from the 'List'(in our case our list is topics). were allowing user to choose the topics(max of 3 for this tutorial).
-the 'list'(topics) will be hold in order they were selected. (so if user chooses 4 from 'list'(topic)the oldest from list is automatically dropped).
